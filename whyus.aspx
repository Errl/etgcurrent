The problem is depending on what your travel needs are for every trip, would determine which one of the three are able to get the best possible option at the best possible price. That is where we come in, we are actually all of the above. This give us a unique perspective on the industry which enables us to to deliver to you, the client, our goal which is:

"always finding the best possible option that suits each individual clients needs"

This is very important, as every client and every trip is different. Important factors that contribute to the best possible option are routing, scheduling, airline, cabin class, and of course price.Since price is of the utmost importance, this is where our competition leaves off. They try to just sell you the cheapest option, that they themselves can come up with. 

This is where we come in, we will always point you in the best direction, no matter what. Even if that means booking a ticket on your own. Our goal is to continue to build string long term relationships, with corporate as well as individuals. We believe the only way to do this is to give the best possible service to every single client, big or small. And  because of our expertise and massive network and partnerships in the industry, we are not limited to only one option. We are one stop source for all of your flight needs and questions.

While everything mentioned above is important in obtaining clients a cost effective price. We at ETG believe that this still comes second to Customer service. Which the airline industry as a whole does not do well. Most companies believe their job stops upon a successful booking of an itinerary. We at ETG believe this is where our job begins!! 

Our customer service is second to none and we can prove it. We have an impeccable reputation as well as a 90 percent client retention rate. No matter where you go to purchase your flights, the most frustrating thing is getting customer service afterwards. Sure, if you have a random question during normal business hours before your trip, you will probably get an answer. However, what about when traveling overseas and you need to get in touch with someone immediately. We all know there are many factors that can interrupt your flight itinerary, weather just being one of them. 

We are one of the only companies in this industry that pride ourselves on providing 24 hour a day customer service, while you are traveling. Being stuck in an airport in HKG with no one to get in touch with, is not a fun experience. Having the confidence of knowing that we are always an email or a call away, can give you great peace of mind. 
</p>

Many of the things mentioned above can only be ascertained after your travel. This is why we offer completely free, no obligation consultations, for whatever your needs or questions might be. Give us a try, what do you have to lose, Let us show you why Elite Travel Guru is the number once source for flight information and booking. Let us be your Luxury Concierge and travel with piece of mind.
